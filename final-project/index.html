<!--I initially used this video for an idea, but ultimately ditched it because I couldn't understand much of the CSS they were doing and I didn't feel right fully copying them. It also would have made my own JS harder.
I found it much easier to go off my previous work along with your other references and past labs that I worked on. I still decided to leave the video here though so you can see what it was like.-->
